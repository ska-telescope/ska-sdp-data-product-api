Interactive API Documentation (Swagger UI)
==========================================

This application provides interactive API documentation using Swagger UI, a powerful tool that allows you to:

* Explore and understand available API endpoints.
* Test API requests directly from your browser.
* View request and response examples.
* Easily understand the required parameters and data formats.

Accessing the Swagger UI:

To access the interactive API documentation, open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:

    `http://<your-api-url>/docs`

Replace `<your-api-url>` with the actual URL of your running API. For example, if your API is running locally on port 8001, the URL might be:

    `http://localhost:8001/docs`

Access to the API can either be configured locally (following the steps on check out the `Developer Guide <developerguide/Development.html>`_),
or there are existing deployments on platforms such as The `STFC cluster <https://sdhp.stfc.skao.int/integration-ska-dataproduct-dashboard/api/docs#/default/>>`_.
